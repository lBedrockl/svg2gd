Get node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Create a SVG file with Geometrize (https://github.com/Tw1ddle/geometrize/releases/download/v1.0.1/geometrize_1.0.1_windows.exe)

place file in Folder, change name in settings.txt

HOME/Documents/GitHub/svg2gd/test.svg

HOME/FOLDER/FOLDER/svg2gd/FILENAME.svg

use runProgram.bat to convert to a gd img

change the color 10 from red to black(im lazy and idk how to code it)
and bg to black cause its nice

also you can only use circle setting in geometrize, you will break code, ;-;

This code is based off of colon's mc2gd code and modified to make imgs
imma just use colon's license





Something is wrong with rbg2hsv but im lazy and its not my code.
